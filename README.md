This project is a component of my PROG6212 Portfolio of Evidence (POE). It is a proof-of-concept web application implemented using ASP.NET Core MVC. The system offers a streamlined submission and approval process for monthly IC instructor claims.

The application is currently developed to be GUI prototype-oriented at this point. There are areas for Instructors to enter and monitor claims, Programme Coordinators can check claims, and Academic Managers can finally approve. The layouts and navigation have been achieved through Razor views and Bootstrap styled. 

Subsequent phases of the project will cover complete features including database integration, authentication, claim calculations, and file uploading
